The file kenken.cpp is a C++14 source file that solves ken ken puzzles.

The puzzle description files are formatted as such:

<Board Size (N)>
<NxN array of chars mapping cells to their clusters' corresponding char>
<List of all clusters' char ids, cluster type (+,-,*,/), and cluster value>

Cells with a given value should be entered as a single-cell cluster with the
addition (+) operator and the given cell value as the cluster value.

The program works by:

1. Load the board from a file

2. Calculate all possible combos for each cluster, independent of other
   clusters.

3. Compare all pairs of clusters' possible combos; when two clusters have
   overlapping rows or columns and there are combos from one which are
   impossible for every possible combination in the other cluster, we remove the
   impossible combination.

4. Repeat step 3 across the entire board as long as it had an effect (combos
   were removed) on the previous iteration. If it didn't have any effect,
   proceed to step 5.

5. If the board is still unsolved, compare all sets of 3 clusters. Let's call
   these clusters A, B, and C.  If A has overlaps with both B and C, and B has
   overlaps with C, then we check all combos of A, B, and C. If there are combos
   in any one of these clusters that are invalid with all combinations of the
   other 2 clusters, then we remove the invalid combos.

6. If reductions have occurred in step 5 and the board is still unsolved, loop
   back to step 3.

If reductions didn't occur in step 5 and the board isn't solved, the algorithm
has failed to find a solution. This doesnt necessarily mean that a solution
doesn't exist. The remainder of the puzzle must be solved via brute force search
through the remainder of the possible combinations (unimplemented thus far).
